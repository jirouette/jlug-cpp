What is *jlug* ? 
-----------------

jlug is a *Pokémon* game base project which tries to look like old Nintendo DS *Pokemon* game such as *Pokémon version Diamond/Pearl/Platinum/HeartGold/SoulSilver* (and not *Black/White*). 
It manages to display 3D map (thanks to OpenGL), with an XML-format based on *TMX Tile Mapping* format.
